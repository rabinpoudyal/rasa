Rules
=====

Rasa rules are a form of training data used to train Rasa's dialogue management models.
Rules describe parts of conversations which should always follow the same path.
Useful applications for rules are for example:

* **FAQs**: FAQs are questions which users ask independent of the current context.
  Rules are an easy way to specify fixed answers to these questions.

* :ref:`fallback-actions`: Users might confront your assistant with unexpected messages.
  The messages will typically receive low intent confidence.
  You can use the :ref:`fallback-classifier` in combination with rules to treat
  messages with low NLU confidence like an FAQ.

* :ref:`forms`: It's a common use case for assistants to collect form-like
  data from the user. Both, activation of forms as well as handling of unexpected
  events as part of a form, are often following fixed paths.

**Don't overuse rules**. They are great to handle small specific conversation parts but
unlike :ref:`stories` rules don't have the power to generalize to unseen conversation
paths. Combine rules and stories to make your assistant robust and able to handle
real user behavior.

Writing a Rule
--------------

Before you start writing rules, you have to make sure that the :ref:`rule-policy`
is added to your model configuration:

.. code-block:: yaml

    policies:
    - ... # Other policies
    - name: RulePolicy

Rules can then be added to the ``rules`` section of your training data.

Rules for the Conversation Start
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To write a rule which only applies at the beginning of a conversation, start with the
intent which starts the conversation and then add the actions which your assistant
should perform in response to that.

.. code-block:: yaml

    rules:

    - rule: Say `hello` when the user starts a conversation with intent `greet`
      steps:
      - intent: greet
      - action: utter_greet

.. _rules-applying-anytime:

Rules which Apply Anytime
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To indicate that a rule can apply at any point in a conversation, specify ``...`` as
first conversation step. The ``...`` indicate that the rule applies independent of the
previous conversation.

.. code-block:: yaml

    rules:

    - rule: Say `hello` whenever the user sends a message with intent `greet`
      steps:
      - ...
      - intent: greet
      - action: utter_greet

This example rule applies at the start of conversation as well as when the user decides
to a send a message with an intent ``greet`` in the middle of an ongoing conversation.

Rules with Pre-Conditions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Rules can describe requirements which have to be fulfilled for the rule to be
applicable. To do so, add any information about the prior conversation, before the
``...``:

.. code-block:: yaml

    rules:

    - rule: Only say `hello` when the user provided a name
      steps:
      - slot: user_provided_name
        value: true
      - ...
      - intent: greet
      - action: utter_greet

Not Predicting `action_listen` at the End of a Rule
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Rules default to wait for the next user message when they finished their last step:

.. code-block:: yaml

    rules:

    - rule: Rule which will wait for user message when it was applied
      steps:
      - intent: greet
      - action: utter_greet
      # Every rule implicitly includes a prediction for `action_listen` as last step.
      # This means that Rasa Open Source will wait for the next user message.
      - action_listen

If you want to hand over to another story or rule, add ``...`` as last step in order to
indicate that the assistant should execute another action before waiting for more user
input.

.. code-block:: yaml

    rules:

    - rule: Rule which will not wait for user message once it was applied
      steps:
      - intent: greet
      - action: utter_greet
      - ...

Rules and Forms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a :ref:`forms` is active, rules become applicable again if

- the form filled all required slots
- the form rejected its execution (see :ref:`section_unhappy` for more details)

.. _rules-use-cases:

Use Cases
---------

This section explains common use cases of rules.

.. _rules-faqs:

FAQs / Mapping Intents to Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some messages do not require any context to answer them. Common examples are either FAQs
or triggers which are sent by :ref:`reminders-and-external-events`.

To map an intent to a certain action, you need :ref:`rules-applying-anytime`. The
following example always responds with an action ``utter_greet`` in case the user
greets the assistant.

.. code-block:: yaml

    rules:

    - rule: Say `hello` whenever the user sends a message with intent `greet`
      steps:
      - ...
      - intent: greet
      - action: utter_greet

Failing Gracefully
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Handling unknown messages gracefully is key to a successful assistant. As unknown
messages can happen at any time in a conversation, they are a special case of
:ref:`rules-faqs`. Please see the docs on :ref:`fallback-actions` for different ways to
handle fallbacks gracefully.

Forms
~~~~~

Use :ref:`forms` if you need to collect multiple pieces of information from a user
before being able to process their request. A common example for this is booking a table
at a restaurant which requires information like name, number of people, and time.
